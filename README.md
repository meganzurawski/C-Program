# C-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For the Airgead Banking App project 2, we had to create pseudocode to plan our project, and use it as an outline to code the actual process. There were lots of required components to this code, ensuring that the correct information was being displayed, the visual was correct, and it calculated everything properly. I think my psuedocode was good, which then helped when i began to code the program. I could have made it print better to make that software look cleaner. The most challenging part was in calculating the interest and the math inside of the code. The skills learned in this project will allow me to do more calculations in any further coding. This program was maintainable, readable, and adaptable due to its layout, being able to change things if needed and swap out amounts for new calculations, and had a great look to it.
